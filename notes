wacky font page 

What book should I use?
-> Something by McLuhan? (did he write any books?)
-> Introduction to Algorithms?



Quirks of the "book":

Typing anything "reprints" the book and takes you back to the index
Takes you to a random next page? -> seems fun
--> Some pages are more rare than others
Rubrication -> add emphasis to parts of the text (handwrite and take a picture)

Branching pattern of pages?


What can I do with the index? -> like a picture of a paperback copy? Maybe just the title in like basic html?
-> That might be pretty interesting


The idea is to explore the interplay of text technologies within the context of modern digital media. Some additional ideas are pulled from what we've explored about editing, translation and mediation.


retain "state"?
-> How could I use state to enhance the reading experience?
--> Change the language based on where you're coming from
