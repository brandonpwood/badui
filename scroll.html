 <div class = "child">   <b>22.2 Breadth-first search</b>
    Breadth-first search is one of the simplest algorithms for searching a graph and
    the archetype for many important graph algorithms. Prim’s minimum-spanningtree algorithm (Section 23.2) and Dijkstra’s single-source shortest-paths algorithm
    (Section 24.3) use ideas similar to those in breadth-first search.
    <hr>
    Given a graph G D .V; E/ and a distinguished source vertex s, breadth-first
    search systematically explores the edges of G to “discover” every vertex that is
    reachable from s. It computes the distance (smallest number of edges) from s
    to each reachable vertex. It also produces a “breadth-first tree” with root s that
    contains all reachable vertices. For any vertex  reachable from s, the simple path
    in the breadth-first tree from s to  corresponds to a “shortest path” from s to
    in G, that is, a path containing the smallest number of edges. The algorithm works
    on both directed and undirected graphs.
    Breadth-first search is so named because it expands the frontier between discovered and undiscovered vertices uniformly across the breadth of the frontier. That
    is, the algorithm discovers all vertices at distance k from s before discovering any
    vertices at distance k C 1.

    To keep track of progress, breadth-first search colors each vertex white, gray, or
    black. All vertices start out white and may later become gray and then black. A
    vertex is discovered the first time it is encountered during the search, at which time
    it becomes nonwhite. Gray and black vertices, therefore, have been discovered, but
    breadth-first search distinguishes between them to ensure that the search proceeds
    in a breadth-first manner.1 If .u; / 2 E and vertex u is black, then vertex
    is either gray or black; that is, all vertices adjacent to black vertices have been
    discovered. Gray vertices may have some adjacent white vertices; they represent
    the frontier between discovered and undiscovered vertices.
    Breadth-first search constructs a breadth-first tree, initially containing only its
    root, which is the source vertex s. Whenever the search discovers a white vertex
    in the course of scanning the adjacency list of an already discovered vertex u, the
    vertex  and the edge .u; / are added to the tree. We say that u is the predecessor
    or parent of  in the breadth-first tree. Since a vertex is discovered at most once, it
    has at most one parent. Ancestor and descendant relationships in the breadth-first
    tree are defined relative to the root s as usual: if u is on the simple path in the tree
    from the root s to vertex , then u is an ancestor of  and  is a descendant of u.
    1We distinguish between gray and black vertices to help us understand how breadth-first search operates. In fact, as Exercise 22.2-3 shows, we would get the same result even if we did not distinguish
    between gray and black vertices.

    22.2 Breadth-first search 595
    The breadth-first-search procedure BFS below assumes that the input graph
    G D .V; E/ is represented using adjacency lists. It attaches several additional
    attributes to each vertex in the graph. We store the color of each vertex u 2 V
    in the attribute u:color and the predecessor of u in the attribute u:. If u has no
    predecessor (for example, if u D s or u has not been discovered), then u: D NIL.
    The attribute u:d holds the distance from the source s to vertex u computed by the
    algorithm. The algorithm also uses a first-in, first-out queue Q (see Section 10.1)
    to manage the set of gray vertices.

    Figure 22.3 illustrates the progress of BFS on a sample graph.
    The procedure BFS works as follows. With the exception of the source vertex s,
    lines 1–4 paint every vertex white, set u:d to be infinity for each vertex u, and set
    the parent of every vertex to be NIL. Line 5 paints s gray, since we consider it to be
    discovered as the procedure begins. Line 6 initializes s:d to 0, and line 7 sets the
    predecessor of the source to be NIL. Lines 8–9 initialize Q to the queue containing
    just the vertex s.
    The while loop of lines 10–18 iterates as long as there remain gray vertices,
    which are discovered vertices that have not yet had their adjacency lists fully examined. This while loop maintains the following invariant:
