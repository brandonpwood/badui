    <!-- 22.1 Representations of graphs
We can choose between two standard ways to represent a graph G D .V; E/:
as a collection of adjacency lists or as an adjacency matrix. Either way applies
to both directed and undirected graphs. Because the adjacency-list representation
provides a compact way to represent sparse graphs—those for which jEj is much
less than jV j
2
—it is usually the method of choice. Most of the graph algorithms
presented in this book assume that an input graph is represented in adjacencylist form. We may prefer an adjacency-matrix representation, however, when the
graph is dense—jEj is close to jV j
2
—or when we need to be able to tell quickly
if there is an edge connecting two given vertices. For example, two of the all-pairs

The adjacency-list representation of a graph G D .V; E/ consists of an array Adj of jV j lists, one for each vertex in V . For each u 2 V , the adjacency list
AdjŒu contains all the vertices  such that there is an edge .u; / 2 E. That is,
AdjŒu consists of all the vertices adjacent to u in G. (Alternatively, it may contain
pointers to these vertices.) Since the adjacency lists represent the edges of a graph,
in pseudocode we treat the array Adj as an attribute of the graph, just as we treat
the edge set E. In pseudocode, therefore, we will see notation such as G:AdjŒu.
Figure 22.1(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the undirected graph in Figure 22.1(a). Similarly, Figure 22.2(b) is an adjacency-list representation of the
directed graph in Figure 22.2(a).
If G is a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is jEj,
since an edge of the form .u; / is represented by having  appear in AdjŒu. If G is

an undirected graph, the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is 2 jEj, since
if .u; / is an undirected edge, then u appears in ’s adjacency list and vice versa.
For both directed and undirected graphs, the adjacency-list representation has the
desirable property that the amount of memory it requires is ‚.V C E/.
We can readily adapt adjacency lists to represent weighted graphs, that is, graphs
for which each edge has an associated weight, typically given by a weight function
w W E ! R. For example, let G D .V; E/ be a weighted graph with weight
function w. We simply store the weight w.u; / of the edge .u; / 2 E with
vertex  in u’s adjacency list. The adjacency-list representation is quite robust in
that we can modify it to support many other graph variants.
A potential disadvantage of the adjacency-list representation is that it provides
no quicker way to determine whether a given edge .u; / is present in the graph
than to search for  in the adjacency list AdjŒu. An adjacency-matrix representation of the graph remedies this disadvantage, but at the cost of using asymptotically
more memory. (See Exercise 22.1-8 for suggestions of variations on adjacency lists
that permit faster edge lookup.)
For the adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G D .V; E/, we assume
that the vertices are numbered 1; 2; : : : ; jV j in some arbitrary manner. Then the
adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G consists of a jV j 	 jV j matrix
A D .aij / such that

1 if .i; j / 2 E ;
0 otherwise :
Figures 22.1(c) and 22.2(c) are the adjacency matrices of the undirected and directed graphs in Figures 22.1(a) and 22.2(a), respectively. The adjacency matrix of
a graph requires ‚.V 2/ memory, independent of the number of edges in the graph.
Observe the symmetry along the main diagonal of the adjacency matrix in Figure 22.1(c). Since in an undirected graph, .u; / and .; u/ represent the same
edge, the adjacency matrix A of an undirected graph is its own transpose: A D AT.
In some applications, it pays to store only the entries on and above the diagonal of
the adjacency matrix, thereby cutting the memory needed to store the graph almost
in half.
Like the adjacency-list representation of a graph, an adjacency matrix can represent a weighted graph. For example, if G D .V; E/ is a weighted graph with edgeweight function w, we can simply store the weight w.u; / of the edge .u; / 2 E
as the entry in row u and column  of the adjacency matrix. If an edge does not
exist, we can store a NIL value as its corresponding matrix entry, though for many
problems it is convenient to use a value such as 0 or 1.
Although the adjacency-list representation is asymptotically at least as spaceefficient as the adjacency-matrix representation, adjacency matrices are simpler,
and so we may prefer them when graphs are reasonably small. Moreover, adja-
