    Note that the results of depth-first search may depend upon the order in which
    line 5 of DFS examines the vertices and upon the order in which line 4 of DFSVISIT visits the neighbors of a vertex. These different visitation orders tend not

    What is the running time of DFS? The loops on lines 1–3 and lines 5–7 of DFS
    take time ‚.V /, exclusive of the time to execute the calls to DFS-VISIT. As we did

        Depth-first search yields valuable information about the structure of a graph. Perhaps the most basic property of depth-first search is that the predecessor subgraph G does indeed form a forest of trees, since the structure of the depthfirst trees exactly mirrors the structure of recursive calls of DFS-VISIT. That is,
        u D : if and only if DFS-VISIT.G; / was called during a search of u’s adjacency list. Additionally, vertex  is a descendant of vertex u in the depth-first
        forest if and only if  is discovered during the time in which u is gray.
    </div>   
    <div class = "boxes">

        Another important property of depth-first search is that discovery and finishing
        times have parenthesis structure. If we represent the discovery of vertex u with
        a leboxes parenthesis “.u” and represent its finishing by a right parenthesis “u/”, then
        the history of discoveries and finishings makes a well-formed expression in the
        sense that the parentheses are properly nested.

    <div class = "boxes">

        For example, the depth-first search
        of Figure 22.5(a) corresponds to the parenthesization shown in Figure 22.5(b). The
        following theorem provides another way to characterize the parenthesis structure.
